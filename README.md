**The Kelly Principle**
* While most gamblers don't know this, the Kelly Principle/ Kelly Criterion is a formula used to determine
the optimal size of a series of bets. In most gambling scenarios, and some investing scenarios under some simplifying assumptions,
**the Kelly strategy will do better than any essentially different strategy in the long run** that is, over a span of time in which the observed fraction of bets that are successful equals the probability that any given bet will be successful. Learn more about it here [Kelly Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion)
